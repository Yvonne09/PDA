This is a set of algorithms and extras, implemented for my Bachelor Thesis in Music Technology Department, Sibelius Academy.

Main files are:
 - all_methods_separately: this applies different Pitch Detection Algorithms to the sound used as input. Also produces figures
 - make_detuned_distorted_drums_sounds: This script creates sounds that are used to train the neural network. To make more realistic sounds it incorporates distortion (clipping after a certain threshold), detuning of harmonics and randomly introduces drums sounds. This is by far the most time-consuming process, depending also on the number of samples and notes to create
 - train_validate_classify: this uses the data set created by the (make_detuned_distorted_drums_sounds) to train and validate a neural network. Then uses the trained neural network for pitch detection.

Auxilliary files (in the main directory):
 - make_sine_sounds: This was used to create a simple melody with sine_waves to test the pitch detection algorithms. It generates the ww_sines.wav file located in the directory sounds
 - crop_and_bind_photos: this was used only for binding figures for the thesis after the figures were generated by matlab.
